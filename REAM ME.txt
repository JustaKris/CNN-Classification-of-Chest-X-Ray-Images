2. Dataset available here -> https://www.kaggle.com/jtiptj/chest-xray-pneumoniacovid19tuberculosis

3. Dataset folder setup -> Create folder named "data" and place dataset inside. Rename the dataset folder itself to "Chest X-Rays".

4. Best models' ids - the following models are required to run the notebook itself:

CNN_basic - 2854197c8ac64b65a1a34d45fe2295d8
CNN_expanded - cc1bc89869524569aef10d7edf816cf8
MobileNet_transfer - 23eea4a5205348fe9245792b35362a81

All 3 are being loaded from the mlruns folder so that would be all that is needed.
